# fusion - The next step after Atom

Fusion is the intersection of a number of good ideas I've encountered over the years
that happens to implement an awesome programmer's editor and programming environment:

* Start with a small kernel that does nothing but bootstrap itself
* Modular, plugin-based design
* The program is written in (and using) itself
* Coding and program execution happen at the same time
* Use Lisp, because Lisp is the first and best language that can be evolved in itself
